   ```tsx
   import { useLanguage } from '@/contexts/LanguageContext';
   
   function MyComponent() {
     const { t } = useLanguage();
     return <h1>{t("section.title")}</h1>;
   }
   ```

See [README_TRANSLATION.md](./README_TRANSLATION.md) for detailed implementation guide.

## 🔑 Authentication Setup
